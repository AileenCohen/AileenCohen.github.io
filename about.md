# About Me

## Research

I’m **Aileen Cohen**, a PhD student in systems and molecular biology at the [Barkai Lab](https://barkailab.wixsite.com/barkai) in the Weizmann Institute of Science.  
My work focuses on uncovering the principles of gene regulation and the dynamics of biological systems in both yeast and humans.

## Curiosity & Writing

Beyond the lab, I’m curious about how science connects to broader questions of human nature and even space exploration.  
I enjoy writing about these intersections on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@AileenCo), where I share both scientific insights and personal reflections.

## Community Involvement

I’m socially involved with [The Aguda](https://www.lgbt.org.il/en), working to combat homophobia and misinformation online.  
I also lead the *Women in Life Sciences Forum* at the Weizmann Institute, supporting community, visibility, and equality in science.
