# Welcome!

Hi, I’m **Aileen Cohen**, a Phd student studying systems and molecular biology.  
I’m fascinated by *gene regulation*, *space biology*, and the complexities of *human nature*.

This site is my small corner of the web where you can explore my research, publications, and projects.

I also write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@AileenCo), where I share thoughts that excite me — both scientifically and personally.
