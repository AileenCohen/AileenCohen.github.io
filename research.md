# My Research

In my MSc, I studied how the mediator complex interacts with its companions and possible genomic locations in yeast.  
Now in my PhD, I’m studying how intrinsically disordered regions affect the binding preferences of different transcription factor families.

## Previous Research Experience

### Feb 2022 – Oct 2022  
**Prof. Osnat Ashur-Fabian’s lab, Tel Aviv University**

- Researched which proteins related to DNA damage repair systems are present in ovarian cancer cells containing p53, PD-L1, and BRCA mutations, specifically from the ID8 cell line.

### Oct 2021 – Dec 2021  
**Dr. Omri Wurtzel’s lab, Tel Aviv University**

- Leveraged FACS and qPCR to research which types of histones (canonical/variant) are present in planarian cells throughout the cell cycle.
- Identified a significant expression of neoblast markers (piwi and SLBP) in differentiated cells 48 hours after amputation.
